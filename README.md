# VBScript Stack Overflow Example
This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: stack overflow due to excessive recursion in functions.  The `bug.vbs` file contains a recursive factorial function that will crash for larger inputs. The solution, `bugSolution.vbs`, provides an iterative version to avoid this issue. This is important for robust VBScript development.
